FAQ
---
1) How do I use ToDo List?
   All you need to do is writing a comment with one of the available marks. Take 
   the following Ruby code:

   class Test
     # NOTE [EXAMPLE] This is just a foo method. Remember to replace it!
     # TODO [EXAMPLE] Check if the method was overwritten
     def foo; end
   end

2) ToDo List is always parsing the same directory. Why?
   If  you use the plugins Filebrowser or EDDT, you need to select the directory
   you want as root directory from its pane.

3) Some files/directories are skipped. Why?
   Only the following file extensions are parsed: py;html;rb;yml;sql;c;php;js;rhtml;erb;rake
   The following directories are automatically skipped: vendor;temp;.svn;CVS;_darcs

4) Can I add more file extensions? Can I skip more directories? Can I add more
   marks keywords?
   For now, this settings are hard-coded. So you need change the constants 
   ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS, SKIPPED_DIRECTORIES and MARKS_REGEX on the todo.rb file.
   As soon as possible, I'll create a GUI for it!

5) How can I add the gedit:// protocol?
   First, execute the following command to copy the protocol handler:

   $ sudo cp ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins/todo/gedit_todo_handler /usr/bin/gedit_todo_handler
   $ sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/gedit_todo_handler
   
   Then, run the following commands:
   
   $ /usr/bin/gconftool-2 -s -t string /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/gedit/command '/usr/bin/gedit_todo_handler "%s"'
   $ /usr/bin/gconftool-2 -s -t bool /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/gedit/enabled true
   
6) What are the requirements for using this plugin?
   Here's my current configuration:
   
   * Ubuntu Feisty Fawn 7.04
   * Gedit 2.18.1
   * Ruby 1.8.5
   * Python GTK MozEmbed libs
   
   But should work with other distros, though.

7) I'm in trouble! What should I do?
   Start Gedit from the command line with the following command:
   
   $ TODO_DEBUG=1 gedit
   
   Select your project and run the "Show ToDo List" command. Send the output by
   e-mail to fnando dot vieira at gmail dot com
   
8) You're a cool guy! Can I give you some money?
   Sure! My Paypal account is fnando dot vieira at gmail dot com

10) The MozEmbed is crashing. What should I do?
    Some distros don't compile Firefox as it should. Just do the following:
    
    * Run this command: sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf.d/firefox.conf
    * Add this line: /usr/lib/firefox
    * Close gedit and run this command: sudo ldconfig
